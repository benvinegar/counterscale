Counterscale is a simple web analytics tracker and dashboard that you self-host on Cloudflare.

It's designed to be easy to deploy and maintain, and should cost you near-zero to operate – even at high levels of traffic (Cloudflare's [free tier](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) could hypothetically support up to 100k hits/day).

**_NOTE: Counterscale is currently in very early development and shouldn't be used in any actual production setting. We welcome people trying it and giving feedback/contributing, but heads up this project is still super early._**

## Installation

### Cloudflare Preparation

If you don't have one already, [create a Cloudflare account here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and verify your email address.

1. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and, if you do not already have one, set up a [Cloudflare Workers subdomain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/)
1. Enable [Cloudflare Analytics Engine beta](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/get-started/) for your account ([screenshot](https://github.com/benvinegar/counterscale/assets/4562878/ad1b5712-2344-4489-a684-685b876635d1))
    1. If this is your first time using Workers, you have to create a Worker before you can enable the Analytics Engine. Navigate to Workers & Pages > Overview, click the "Create Worker" button ([screenshot](./docs/create-worker.png)) to create a "Hello World" worker (it doesn't matter what you name this Worker as you can delete it later).
1. Create a [Cloudflare API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/). This token needs `Account.Account Analytics` permissions at a minimum ([screenshot](./docs/api-token.png)).
    - _WARNING: Keep this window open or copy your API token somewhere safe (e.g. a password manager), because if you close this window you will not be able to access this API token again and have to start over._

### Deploy Counterscale

1. Download the [latest Counterscale release](https://github.com/benvinegar/counterscale/releases/latest) (or clone the repository) and extract the source files to a folder.
1. With your terminal, navigate to the folder containing the source files.
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npx wrangler pages project create counterscale` and create a new Pages project.
    1. You will be prompted to enter the "production branch name". Just use the default provided.
    - _NOTE: If this is your first time invoking `wrangler` on the terminal, you will be prompted to sign into your Cloudflare account._
1. Run `npx wrangler pages secret put CF_BEARER_TOKEN` → when prompted, paste the API token you created
1. Run `npx wrangler pages secret put CF_ACCOUNT_ID` → when prompted, paste your Cloudflare Account ID
    - Find your account ID by visiting Workers and Pages > Overview. It is displayed on the right hand side of the screen.
1. Run `npx turbo deploy` – this will do several things:
    1. Create a new Analytics Engine dataset, called `metricsDataset`
    1. Deploy the site and give you the deployment URL.
1. The site should now be deployed. Visit `https://{subdomain-emitted-from-npm-run-deploy}.pages.dev`.
    - NOTE: _It may take take a few minutes before the subdomain becomes live._

### Install the Tracking Script on Your Website(s)

When Counterscale is deployed, it makes `tracker.js` available at the URL you deployed to:

```
https://{subdomain-emitted-from-npm-run-deploy}.pages.dev/tracker.js
```

To start reporting website traffic from your web property, copy/paste the following snippet into your website HTML:

```html
<script 
    src="https://{subdomain-emitted-from-npm-run-deploy}.pages.dev/tracker.js"
    defer
></script>
```

## Troubleshooting

If the website is not immediately available (e.g. "Secure Connection Failed"), it could be because Cloudflare has not yet activated your subdomain (yoursubdomain.workers.dev). This process can take a minute; you can check in on the progress by visiting the newly created worker in your Cloudflare dashboard (Workers & Pages → counterscale).

## Custom Domains

The deployment URL can always be changed to go behind a custom domain you own. [More here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/).

## Development

### Config

To get started, in the `packages/server` folder, copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars`.

Open `.dev.vars` and enter the same values for `CF_BEARER_TOKEN` and `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` you used earlier.

### Running the Server

Counterscale is built on Remix and Cloudflare Workers. In development, you have two options:

1. `npx turbo dev` → This runs the Vite development server in Node.js. This server will automatically rebuild files when you change them, but it does not best reflect Cloudflare's serverless platform.
2. `npx turbo preview` → This runs Cloudflare's Miniflare server with a build of the Remix files. This closer matches the deployment environment, but does not (yet) automatically rebuild your app.

## Notes

### Database

There is only one "database": the Cloudflare Analytics Engine dataset, which is communicated entirely over HTTP using Cloudflare's API.

Right now there is no local "test" database. This means in local development:

- Writes will no-op (no hits will be recorded)
- Reads will be read from the production Analaytics Engine dataset (local development shows production data)

### Sampling

Cloudflare Analytics Engine uses sampling to make high volume data ingestion/querying affordable at scale (this is similar to most other analytics tools, see [Google Analytics on Sampling](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2637192?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article)). You can find out more how [sampling works with CF AE here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sampling/).

## Contributing

Counterscale development is 100% volunteer-driven. If you use and like this software and want to see it improve, we encourage you to contribute with Issues or Pull Requests.

### Development Philosophy

The primary goal of Counterscale is to be super easy to self-host and maintain. It should be "set up once and forget".

To achieve that:

- There should be no application state outside of CF Analytics Engine
    - e.g. no additional relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
    - That means no `users` table, no `sites` table, etc.
    - This also means retention will be limited by what CF Analytics Engine provides. While it could be possible to stand up a "hit counter" for long-lived data (e.g. years), that would mean another database, which we will not pursue.
- We prioritize backwards compatibility
    - New `metricsDataset` columns can be added, but old columns cannot be removed or renamed (they can however, be "forgotten").
    - That also means it's okay if a feature only works during a period where the data is active.
